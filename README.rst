ansible-collections.python.dist.boo: an Ansible Collection containing a boo module
==================================================================================

This is a demo of an `Ansible Collection`_ ``python.dist`` packaged
as a `Python distribution package`_. It contains only one `Ansible
module`_ called ``boo``. Given that this dist and Ansible are
installed into the same (virtual)env, it's accessible from Ansible by
`FQDN`_ ``python.dist.boo``. Here's how you can call it adhoc-style::

    $ PYTHONPATH=`pwd` ansible -m python.dist.boo -a name=Bob localhost
    [WARNING]: No inventory was parsed, only implicit localhost is available
    localhost | SUCCESS => {
        "changed": false,
        "greeting": "Hello, Bob!",
        "msg": "Greeting Bob completed."
    }

Alternatively, install it, instead of mangling with ``PYTHONPATH``::

    $ pip install ansible-collections.python.dist.boo
    $ ansible -m python.dist.boo -a name=Bob localhost
    [WARNING]: No inventory was parsed, only implicit localhost is available
    localhost | SUCCESS => {
        "changed": false,
        "greeting": "Hello, Bob!",
        "msg": "Greeting Bob completed."
    }

Purpose
-------

At the moment of publishing this project, this demo only works with
the code supplied by `Ansible PR #67093`_. One can test it by
installing Ansible from that PR-branch::

    $ pip install git+https://github.com/sivel/ansible@acd-content-dir

.. _`Ansible PR #67093`: https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/67093

Publishing to PyPI
------------------

This project implements automatic building and publishing of a Python
distribution package to PyPI for tagged commits and to TestPyPI for
every push to ``master``. All the heavy lifting is done by the
combination of GitHub Actions CI/CD workflows, ``pep517`` CLI tool and
``setuptools-scm``.

The published dists are then installable by::

    $ pip install ansible-collections.python.dist.boo  # for PyPI

and

  ::

    $ pip install ansible-collections.python.dist.boo \
          -i https://test.pypi.org/simple/ --pre  # for TestPyPI

If you're learning by example, take a look at the following files:

  * ``pyproject.toml``
  * ``setup.cfg``
  * ``.github/workflows/publish-to-test-pypi.yml``

Besides, you can follow a `PyPA guide about publishing packages via
GitHub Actions`_ that will walk you through the process.
